Current Issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue: C:\Users\leveckis\Documents\code\living_database\livingdatabase\models\DatabaseC
onnect.py:141: UserWarning: pandas only supports SQLAlchemy connectable (engine/
connection) or database string URI or sqlite3 DBAPI2 connection. Other DBAPI2 ob
jects are not tested. Please consider using SQLAlchemy.
  df2 = pd.read_sql_query(sql, pg_conn)

    Might have to use SQLAlchemy

Issue: confine database/table window so that it doesnt jump when user selects a table. 
Never will need a third column. Ideally just restrict the window to two columns

Issue: Allow user to resize window

Minor issue: slidery drag thing that moves border between (table/database) and (table viewport) 
so that one can be larger

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra Functionality:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
save dictionary data into a file so we don't have to connect, 
have a resfresh button to re-load that if they thinkthey need to regrab the data
    similarly, caching tables themselves

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solved Issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Huge Issue: ViewWhatever.selectionModel()
or something like that to return the selection model object or at least 
something that basically resembles that object
then look at the repo patrick sent to get an idea about using that model
for slots and signals
DONE (didn't need to use selection model, view object had a builtin method)

Medium Issue: Still executing queries for tables when the table name was actually a database name,
due to the fact that we're execute that method every time the user clicks on something
(and of course sometimes they'll click on a database)

Huge Issue: Method of getting relevant database gets wrong database if multiple Databases
have a table with the same name (this is common)

Issue: User can't see fields/column names of table

Medium issue: should everything that shows up in 'table' be something we can view as a table?
Some things aren't rendering still... or are they? Check to be sure, but when I have PGAdmin
so I can also check that whatever's rendering is rendering correctly
ie, clicking on a table in xmat says "relation [table_name] does not exist"... 
  - The solution was that any table with capital(s) in its name, or starts with a number, must be surrounded by quotes
  in a query

Minor issue: display database and table lists in alphabetical order. havent done table lists
